# ü§ñ Replit Follower Bot 
A well-made simplisitc Replit follow bot. Put tokens in "tokens.txt", and run "main.py".

# ‚öíÔ∏è Prerequisites 
Install the requests module, if you don't have it already and then your set as that's the only module required to run this.

Put all of your tokens in tokens.txt with the format of `username:email:password:token`, they may be verified as verifying prevents flags (if you have aged tokens this won't affect you), but **cannot** be flagged.  If you don't already have tokens, feel free to buy some [@ my sellix](https://bleedspace.mysellix.io/product/639fa6fab1898)
# ‚ú¥Ô∏è Running
Simply run `main.py` with python and your set.
